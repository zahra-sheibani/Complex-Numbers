# Complex-Numbers
This C++ program defines a Complex class to represent and perform arithmetic operations on complex numbers.\
The class overloads the +, -, and * operators to allow addition, subtraction, and multiplication of complex numbers.\
It also implements pre-increment (++x), post-increment (x++), pre-decrement (--x), and post-decrement (x--) operators to modify the real part of the complex number.\
The print function provides a formatted output of the complex number, ensuring proper representation of both positive and negative imaginary values.\
The program demonstrates these functionalities by performing operations on sample complex numbers and displaying the results.
